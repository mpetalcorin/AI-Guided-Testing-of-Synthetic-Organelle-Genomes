An AI-driven, high-throughput multi-omics phenotyping platform that simulates the testing of thousands of synthetic mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, accelerating the design-build-test-learn cycle for breakthroughs in human health, bioenergy, agriculture, and climate resilience.

**Summary**\
Mitochondria and chloroplasts are essential for energy and photosynthesis, but the challenge is that natural systems are inefficient and current lab testing methods are too slow to evaluate thousands of synthetic designs. Our goal is to build an AI-driven, high-throughput phenotyping platform to test thousands of synthetic organelle genomes at once and identify top-performing designs, which is relevant in transforming human health, improving agriculture, accelerating bioenergy production, enhancing climate resilience, and creating a self-improving AI-driven discovery ecosystem.

**Overview**\
This repository contains a proof-of-concept simulation demonstrating an AI-driven, high-throughput phenotyping system for testing synthetic mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes.\
The pipeline integrates artificial intelligence (AI), multi-omics analysis, and automated robotics to evaluate thousands of AI-generated synthetic organelle designs simultaneously, mimicking the TEST phase of a Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) framework of making biology engineerable by writing and testing programmable organelle genomes.

**Scientific Motivation**\
Inside every living cell, mitochondria and chloroplasts act as tiny energy factories. **Mitochondria** produce ATP, the fuel that powers life.
**Chloroplasts** capture sunlight and convert CO₂ into sugars through photosynthesis. By reprogramming their genomes using AI-guided design, we can create synthetic organelles optimized for **human health** (fixing mitochondrial dysfunctions, aging, and disease), **bioenergy** (engineering chloroplasts and algae for hydrogen production), **climate resilience** (developing crops with enhanced stress tolerance), and **carbon capture** (designing photosynthetic systems for sustainable agriculture). But before deploying these designs, we need a scalable way to test thousands of synthetic genomes simultaneously. This repository provides a virtual simulation of that high-throughput testing process. This project models the TEST stage of the **Design-Build-Test-Learn** workflow.

**Features** 

**1. Mitochondrial Phenotyping**\
Tests synthetic mitochondrial genome designs using simulated multi-omics assays:
	•	ATP Production: measures energy efficiency\
	•	Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR): evaluates respiratory capacity\
	•	ROS Accumulation: detects oxidative stress levels\
	•	Membrane Potential (ΔΨm): assesses energy stability

**2. Chloroplast Phenotyping**\
Tests synthetic chloroplast genome designs for photosynthesis optimization:
	•	Photosynthetic Efficiency (PE): light-to-energy conversion performance\
	•	RuBisCO Kinetics: CO₂ fixation rate\
	•	Pigment Balance: optimizes light absorption and protection\
	•	Stress Resilience: tests survival under drought, heat, and high light

**3. Unified Reporting**\
	•	Threshold-based pass/fail scoring\
	•	Automatic ranking of top-performing synthetic designs\
	•	Multi-panel visualizations: Bar charts for pass rates, Boxplots for assay quality control, Heatmaps for top performers

**4. Why we care?**\
This project embodies the vision of:\
	•	Writing the natural language of biology: AI designs synthetic organelle genomes from scratch.\
	•	Understanding what to write: Predicts which sequences drive desired energy and stress-related functions.\
	•	Testing at scale: Robotic multi-omics platforms simulate thousands of parallel experiments.\
	•	Translating discoveries into impact: Health, agriculture, energy, and climate solutions converge in one program.

When successful, this work will contribute to how we engineer life’s inner energy systems, making synthetic biology faster, smarter, and scalable.
